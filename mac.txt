Running gcc under Snow Leopard requires an under-score in front of the function names in mrmuldv.s64

So muldiv becomes _muldiv, etc.


On a MAC using GCC, use the flag

-mdynamic-no-pic

when compiling MIRACL assembly language modules..

(Thanks Augusto)

There is also a known problem with the mac port of g++ involving friend
declarations in big.h and zzn.h. This can be solved by substituting the files
in ./source/mac for the ones found in ./include and ./source
